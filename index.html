<hr>
<p>Propellants are the materials that are combusted by the engine to produce thrust.</p>
<h2>Bipropellants</h2>
<p>Bipropellant liquid rocket systems consists of a fuel and an oxidizer.They are a common propellant because of their high performance,but are more complex</p>
<h2>Monopropellants</h2>
<p>Several propellants can be used singularly(monopropellants),as they release energy when they decompose either by getting heated or catalyzed.</p>
<br>
<h3>There are mainly three primary propellant type:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Storable</li>
<li>Space Storable</li>
<li>Cryogenic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Storable propellants</h2>
<ul>
<li>They aare liquid at sea level of temperature and pressure.Thus,it can be stored indefinitely in tanks.</li>
<li>The drawback of this type of propellants is that,with the exception of kerosene-based propellants,they are highly toxic,reactive,corrosive and difficult to handle</li>
<li>They are mostly hypergolic(spontaneously ignite when in contact with each other in fuels and the oxidizer)</li>
<ul>
<li>Hypergolic propellants are used for small thrust applications.</li>
<li>Elimination of ignition system provides thrsust on demand and pulse mode</li>
</ul>
<li>Monopropellants</li>
<ol>
<li>They are storable liquid propellants which are induced to decompose to gases in presence of a catalyst,which releases heat to convert it to thrust</li>
<li>The performance is lower than that of bipropellant systems but it is simpler which provides a high reliability</li>
<li>One drawback is that due to its high reliability,a high standard of cleanliness is needed</li>
<li>Examples</li>
<ul>
<li>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(Hydrogen peroxide)</li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(Hydrazine)</li>
<li>UDMH(Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Space Storable propellants</h2>
<ul>
<li>They are liquid in temperature of space and heir net boiling point is 230<sup>o</sup>R(Rankine)</li>
<li>They can be stored for a longer time than cryogenic propellants in space</li>
<li>They are more energetic than most of the storable propellants,but are rarely used due to their extreme toxicity,reactivity and handling difficulty.</li>
<li>It is rarely used in operational propulsion systems.</li>
<li>Examples</li>
<ul>
<li>LO<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub></li>
<li>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub></li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>(Tetrafluorohydrazine)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Cryogenic propellants</h2>
<ul>
<li>They are liquified gases at very low temperatures(30<sup>o</sup>-230<sup>o</sup>R) and are the most energetic propellants.</li>
<li>They are hard to store for a long time as venting of the tanks are needed.</li>
<li>LO<sub>2</sub> and LH<sub>2</sub> are the most common cryogenic propellants</li>
<ol>
<li>LH<sub>2</sub></li>
<ul>
<li>Advantages:It has a high performance and is an excellent coolant</li>
<li>Dis-advantages:They have less density,thus this will increase tank size</li>
</ul>
<li>LO<sub>2</sub></li>
<ul>
<li>Advantages:It has a high performance and Flourine is the only better oxidizer than LO<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>Dis-advantages:It is not selective of what it uses as a fuel but it prefers hydrogen.It also oxidizes almost everything(consumes with ozidation potential)</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<li>Examples</li>
<ul>
<li>LH<sub>2</sub>(Liquid Hydrogen)</li>
<li>LO<sub>2</sub>(Liquid Oxygen)</li>
<li>OF<sub>2</sub>(Oxygen Diflouride)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
